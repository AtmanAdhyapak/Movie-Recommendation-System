# Movie-Recommendation-System
An interactive movie recommendation system built in Python that combines TF-IDF–based title similarity with user rating behavior to generate personalized recommendations. Users can search by movie title or browse top-rated films by genre through a Jupyter Notebook interface. The project focuses on clean data preprocessing, similarity scoring, ranking logic, and building a simple, explainable recommendation pipeline.

Note: Interactive widgets require running the notebook locally to be fully functional.
