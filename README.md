# Movie-Recommendation-System
A movie recommendation system that outputs the recommended movies that the user types in a search engine. 
An interactive movie recommendation system built in Python that combines TF-IDF–based title similarity with user rating behavior to generate personalized recommendations. Users can search by movie title or browse top-rated movies by genre through a Jupyter Notebook interface. The project emphasizes clean data preprocessing, similarity scoring, and practical recommendation logic, with a focus on usability and explainability.
