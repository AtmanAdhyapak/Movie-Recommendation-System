# Movie-Recommendation-System
An interactive movie recommendation system built in Python that combines TF-IDF–based title similarity with user rating behavior to generate personalized recommendations. Users can search by movie title or browse top-rated films by genre through a Jupyter Notebook interface. The project focuses on clean data preprocessing, similarity scoring, ranking logic, and building a simple, explainable recommendation pipeline.

This project uses the MovieLens 25M dataset provided by GroupLens Research. The dataset can be downloaded from: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

Note: GitHub does not render interactive Jupyter widgets. A short demo gif video is included to demonstrate the title search and genre-based recommendation functionality.
