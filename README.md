# Movie-Recommendation-System
An interactive movie recommendation system built in Python that combines TF-IDF–based title similarity with user rating behavior to generate personalized recommendations. Users can search by movie title or browse top-rated films by genre through a Jupyter Notebook interface. The project focuses on clean data preprocessing, similarity scoring, ranking logic, and building a simple, explainable recommendation pipeline.

Note: GitHub does not render interactive Jupyter widgets. A short demo gif video is included to demonstrate the title search and genre-based recommendation functionality.
